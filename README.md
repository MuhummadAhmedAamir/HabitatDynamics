#  Habitat Dynamics: An Interactive Wildlife Ecosystem Simulation

##  Project Overview 
This simulation models a simple wildlife ecosystem with organisms like plants, herbivores, and carnivores, each behaving according to biological rules. The ecosystem reacts dynamically to factors like time of day, population changes, and user-triggered events (e.g., pandemic or extinction tracking). The simulation runs in real-time and allows user interaction to observe ecosystem changes and balance.

##  Main Features
- Organisms (plants, herbivores, carnivores) with realistic behavior.
- Plants reproduce under sunlight and low population conditions.
- Herbivores eat plants and move if hungry.
- Carnivores hunt herbivores and have larger detection radii.
- Environment with day/night cycles, population tracking, and user-triggered events.
- Extinction Monitoring: Tracks species populations and issues extinction warnings.
- User Interactions: Modify population counts, start events like pandemics, and observe outcomes.
-  System: Organisms lose/gain energy based on actions.
- Logger class to track key simulation events (e.g., death, reproduction, extinction).
- Binary File Handling: Simulation state can be saved and restored.
